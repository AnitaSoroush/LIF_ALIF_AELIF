# LIF_ALIF_AELIF

[LIF_ALIF_AELIF.inbpy]() contains:
* An implementation of LIF neuron model (Leaky Integrate and Fire), Adaptive LIF and Adaptive Exponential LIF from scratch.
* An implementation of 5 different currents to be the input of our neurons.
* An implementation of Line graphs that represent **membrane potential** of each neuron when exposed to each input current.
* An implementation of Line graphs that represent the **frequency of firing** of each neuron when exposed to each input current.

[Report.pdf]() contains:
* A complete explanation of required mathematics.
* The results of the project.
